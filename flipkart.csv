0,Pallavi Kumari,"Good at this price range ‚ù§Ô∏è , 64gb card and a bag was included but the bag is too small. No extra lens can be carried. Talking about the photos and video's , the  photo's are good detailed..the 4k video looks so good. Overall a nice camera at this budget..."
1,Mohd Saud,I‚Äôm a Food Vlogger. I have been using my old Canon Dslr 1200D from past 2 years for Food Videography but I wasn‚Äôt happy with the video quality. Then I purchased this and rest is history. This Beautiful Camera not just improved my quality but made my work more easier with it‚Äôs advance features. Best Camera in this price range. ‚ù§Ô∏è

3,Sumit  Rathod,Pretty good and genuine product from Flipkart. I got this camera right in time. Every other websites had it out of stock while Flipkart was having few units remaining. Overall a good service from Flipkart.
4,Meghna  Paul,"Excellent packaging and service by Flipkart. Inside the box: camera body, 16-50mm lens, rechargeable battery, shoulder strap, camera bag, wind screen adaptor, body cap, usb, power adaptor, 64gb memory card. It's a steal deal for a mirrorless. Don't think just go for it! Best entry-level budget mirrorless."
5,Nihar Ranjan Biswas,My dream camera. I'm highly satisfied.
6,Shammi Kapoor,Really very good camera and flip kart number 1 in service + delivery boy behavior very good
7,DEEPAK DILEEP,ZV-E10 essentially the spirit of Sony's ZV-1 vlogging compact scaled up as an entry-level APS-C ILC.I loved it üòçDrawback is the bag which is small.
8,Pradeep M,The best camera in the entry level segment.. Was looking for 6400 or 6600 but the budget is too high for a beginner level. Then came the cute little ZV E10 with some compromise of No EVF (Electronic view finder) not built as good as 6600. But this compact body and sony colour science articulating screen Type C port wifi nfc sharing is nice exchange of deal with the compromises. Options of lenses are another reason to buy this little giant.
9,Ketan Pagar,One of the best cameras in this price range the colours and details in the photos is exceptional. The videos are professional grade and cinematic bokeh effext works flawlessly. The camera works exceptionally well in low light situations and captures maximum details
